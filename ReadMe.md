## Idea
Human body has 4.7-5.5 litres of blood in circulation. We know the importance of this fixed amount of blood in the body and also that a drop in it's amount can be fatal. Thousands of people lose their life in accidents or due to diseases when they are not provided with blood for life support in the required time.

Humans are too sensitive to pain and need. Nobody wants anyone(not only their loved ones) suffer or die due to unavailability of blood or blood components. An Easy interactive Android application to provide you with an easy and convenient availability of the required blood and blood components during all extreme situations.

Information regarding nearby blood donation camps, hospitals and blood banks.

## Installation
